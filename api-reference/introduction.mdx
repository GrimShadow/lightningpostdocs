## Authentication

An API key is required to authenticate with the Lightning-POST API. You can generate an API key by logging into your Lightning-POST account and navigating to the API settings page.

## Webhooks

Lightning-POST supports webhooks to notify your application when certain events occur. You can configure webhooks in your Lightning-POST account settings to receive notifications for events such as email delivery, social media post creation, and more.

## Rate Limits

Lightning-POST enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage of the API. If you exceed the rate limits, you will receive a 429 status code in response to your API request. You can view your current rate limit status by inspecting the response headers of your API requests.

## Support
